Strategy:
- Load browser
- Load a twitter search query link
- Scroll down to a high threshold [~5000]
-- Scrolling down to such Y position would mean that twitter feed is forced to load an hour worth of old content
- Now gradually scroll up
-- This way we can constantly parse data and as we scroll up twitter automatically updates its list with new tweets


Parsing:
- Tweets are separated by a '.'
- This '.' is however offset by +2 for tweets
- Tweets follow a pattern where it is like:
-- Name, ID, ., Time
